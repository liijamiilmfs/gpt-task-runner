# GPT Task Runner - Project Roadmap & Milestones

## Project Overview
A comprehensive task runner and automation tool designed to work with GPT models for intelligent task execution and workflow management, featuring both CLI and web dashboard interfaces.

## Current State Assessment
- ✅ Core functionality implemented (CLI, web dashboard, task processing)
- ✅ Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Security scanning and dependency management
- ✅ TypeScript implementation with proper typing
- ⚠️ Documentation needs enhancement
- ⚠️ API documentation missing
- ⚠️ Deployment automation needs improvement
- ⚠️ Monitoring and observability gaps

   - *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent queuing and retry mechanisms
2. **Data Security**: Sensitive task data handling
   - *Mitigation*: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
3. **Scalability**: High concurrent task processing
   - *Mitigation*: Implement horizontal scaling and load balancing

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Third-party package security
   - *Mitigation*: Automated security scanning and updates
2. **Performance Degradation**: Large task volumes
   - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Lead Developer**: Full-time (40h/week)
- **DevOps Engineer**: Part-time (20h/week)
- **QA Engineer**: Part-time (15h/week)
- **Technical Writer**: Part-time (10h/week)

### Infrastructure
