## Proposed Issues for TopTier Phases (non-overlapping)

Use these if automation cannot create them via GitHub CLI.

Labels to apply: `type: chore`, `area: repo`, `area: ci`, `area: docs`, `top-tier`, `priority: high` as applicable.

### Phase 0 — Dry Run & Scaffolding
- Enforce branch protection rules for main and dev
- Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- Add SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure
- Configure Codecov secret and verify coverage uploads

### Phase 4 — Packaging & CI/CD
- Add PR Labeler workflow for path-based labels
- Configure stale issue/PR automation
